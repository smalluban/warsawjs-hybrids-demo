# WarsawJS Lightning Talk Demo

This is a demo repository for WarsawJS Lightning Talk, given on 2022-09-14. It contains a simple client-side application showing set of features of the [hybrids](https://hybrids.js.org) JavaScript framework.

## Usage

The code is prepared to work without any build step, or `npm` installation. The only requirement is to run `src/index.html` by simple http server (to avoid `file` protocol restrictions).

However, for a better development experience, you can install `npm` dependencies and run the application with `npm start` command. The project uses Vite, so you can use all the features of the bundler, like hot module replacement.
